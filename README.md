Mongoid Taggable
================

[![Build Status][]][travis-project]

Mongoid Taggable provides some helpers to create taggable documents.

Installation
------------

This project is a fork that has drifted quite a bit from the original
maintainer's version, and currently has not been re-released as a gem. See
details on the fork changes in the `CHANGELOG` file.

Using Bundler, in your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'mongoid_taggable', :git => 'https://github.com/ches/mongoid_taggable.git',
                            :branch => 'integration'

or as a Rails Plugin:

    rails plugin install git://github.com/ches/mongoid_taggable.git

Basic Usage
-----------

To make a document taggable you need to include `Mongoid::Taggable` into your
document and call the `taggable` macro with optional arguments:

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable
  
  field :title
  field :content
  
  taggable
end
```

Then in your form, for example:

```rhtml
<% form_for @post do |f| %>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :title %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :title %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :content %><br />
    <%= f.text_area :content %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <%= f.label :tags %><br />
    <%= f.text_field :tags %>
  </p>
  <p>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
  </p>
<% end %>
```

The text field should receive a list of tags separated by comma (below in this
document you will see how to change the separator).

Your document will have a custom `tags=` setter which can accept either an
ordinary Array or this separator-delineated String.

Tag Aggregation with Counts
---------------------------

This lib can automatically create an aggregate collection of tags and their
counts for you, updated as documents are saved. This is useful for getting a
list of all tags used in documents of this collection or to create a tag cloud.
This is disabled by default for sake of performance where it is unneeded -- see
the following example to understand how to use it:

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable

  field :title
  field :content

  taggable :aggregation => true
end

Post.create!(:tags => "food,ant,bee")
Post.create!(:tags => "juice,food,bee,zip")
Post.create!(:tags => "honey,strip,food")

Post.tags
# => ["ant", "bee", "food", "honey", "juice", "strip", "zip"]

Post.tags_with_weight # will retrieve:
# [
#   ['ant', 1],
#   ['bee', 2],
#   ['food', 3],
#   ['honey', 1],
#   ['juice', 1],
#   ['strip', 1],
#   ['zip', 1]
# ]
```

You may also trigger aggregation on-demand rather than setting the automatic
option, to run it from a background task for instance, by calling
`Post.aggregate_tags!`.

If you need to modify the criteria used for the aggregation you may do so as an
option to 'taggable':

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable
  
  field :title
  field :content
  field :published, :type => Boolean
  
  taggable :aggregation_options => { :query => { :published => true } }
end
```

A full list of available options can be found at [the ruby driver
API][mapreduce-doc] (consult the appropriate version).

Changing default separator
--------------------------

To change the default separator you may pass a `separator` argument to the
macro:

```ruby
class Post
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Taggable

  field :title
  field :content

  taggable :separator => ' '    # tags will be delineated by spaces
end
```

### TODO: ###

* Should subclasses output map/reduce aggregation results to their own
  collections?
* Perhaps implement operators, <<, etc. for full-on set semantics. See:
